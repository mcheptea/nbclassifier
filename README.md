# PHP Naive Bayes Classifier

A simple php based Naive-Bayes text classifier.

The Naive-Bayes classifier is a statistical classifier which relies on a "trained set" 
to classify documents.

Documents are chunks of plain text, classes are any type of class structure a document ay fall under.
Examples: Restaurant Menu <-> Food Type, Vocabulary <-> Language, Novel <-> Author

## How does it work?

Before starting to use the classifier you **should train it**.

This package comes with both a Trainer and a Classifier. To achieve good performance 
it is recommended to train at least *200* documents before using the classifier.

*Note:* The 200 document number is an *arbitrarily high* number. As with any machine learner 
a *golden mean number* should be encountered for each specific case.
